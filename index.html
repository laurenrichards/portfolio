    <h3>A Little Bit About Me</h3>
     <p>In 2019, I graduated from Loyola University Maryland with my Bachelor's degree in Biology. I've been working in the healthcare field since and found a new interest in technology while working in a dental office. </p>
      <p>I've always been the creative type, but also very science-minded. This field is the perfect combination of the the two! </p>
      <p>I am so fortunate to have found 
        <a href="https://www.thinkful.com" target="_blank">Thinkful</a> and am excited to jump start a career in software development!</p>
